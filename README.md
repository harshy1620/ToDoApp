This GitHub repository contains the source code for a Todo app, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides basic functionality for managing a list of tasks.

## Project Overview

The Todo app is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage a list of tasks. It provides an intuitive interface for adding new tasks, marking them as completed, and deleting tasks. Additionally, the app dynamically displays the total number of tasks mentioned.

The project utilizes HTML to structure the user interface, CSS to style the elements, JavaScript to handle user interactions and manage the task list and LocalStorage to store the list of tasks.

## Features

The Todo app offers the following features:

1. **Task Creation**: Users can easily create new tasks by entering a task description in the input field and pressing the "Add" button or hitting the Enter key. The app adds the task to the list, displaying it along with the existing tasks.

2. **Task Completion**: Users can mark a task as completed by clicking on a checkbox associated with the task. The app visually indicates completed tasks, making it easy to differentiate them from pending tasks.

3. **Task Deletion**: Users can remove a task from the list by clicking on a delete button associated with each task. The app instantly removes the task from the list, keeping the interface clean and organized.

4. **Total Task Count**: The app dynamically displays the total number of tasks mentioned, providing users with an overview of the number of tasks they have.
